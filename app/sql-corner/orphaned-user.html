  Creating a database from a backup on a new server will likely lead to a user without a login, also known as an <b>orphaned</b> user. Although the login and user
  may be on the server and database, they may not be linked together. To detect any orphaned users on the database execute the following query:

  <pre class='sql'>
    <keyword>EXEC</keyword> <system>sp_change_users_login</system> @Action = <string>'Report'</string>
  </pre>

  Once you have identified any orphaned users, fixing them is extremely easy. Simply run the same statement
  <pre class='sql'>
    <keyword>EXEC</keyword> <system>sp_change_users_login</system> @Action = <string>'Auto_Fix', 'INSERT_LOGIN_HERE'
  </pre>
