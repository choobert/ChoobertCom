		The last few days has led to the introduction of the crosshair, damage, and a few simplistic effects.
		When a player fires a shot, a small particle effect is played at the location of the shot, and a fading LineRenderer
		is drawn towards its destination. This allows for a pretty neat effect that looks as if sparks are flying out of
		the gun and a "bullet" is drawn for other players to know a shot has taken place. Also, based on where the shot
		has been taken (since it is a 3D sound), a sound clip is played. Interestingly enough, headphones will play them
		out of the correct side, right out of the box! Awesome!

		<br><br>
		Unfortunately current shots are taken out of the players head. This will be corrected in future posts.
