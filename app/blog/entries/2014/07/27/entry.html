		I have spend the last few weeks working through several Unity 3D and Blender tutorials getting a general
		understanding of 3D game development. Many of the tutorials I have completed have been proved by
		<a href="http://quill18.com">Quill18</a> 
		on both his website and YouTube channel. Following these guides I have successfully implemented weapons in a First
		Person Shooter game that act similar to both an automatic and semi-automatic rifle as well as a rocket launcher with
		splash damage. My current goal is to create a multiplayer FPS game that is capable of combining several weapons
		and allowing for actual multiplayer play.

		<br><br>
		Having completed the first 8 portions of the Multiplayer FPS guide provided by Quill18, I have successfully
		created an environment in which up to 20 players can connect to each other using the Photon 3D Network
		(free accounts are limited to 20 unique connections) and explore the environment. The repository is on my GitHub, check it out!
