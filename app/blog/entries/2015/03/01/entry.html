    After completion of the 2D training by Microsoft I have been re-inspired to attempt vector art for Breadjamin Butters.
    I certainly acknowledge that Breadjamin needs some work still but he looks far better than he ever has in the past.

    Although I very much like the new art I hope to participate in the #OneGameAMonth challenge. I think that completing a
    very simple game a month will not only force me to have a deadline but also make me stop spec creep.
