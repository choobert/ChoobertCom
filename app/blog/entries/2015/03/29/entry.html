    Woah, where did the last two days go? A whirlwind of coding, music-ing, and drawing, throwing out my drawings,
    and drawing again. But, I am proud to say that I completed not only my first Game Jam, but also my first game
    that is actually playable for others. Yea, yea I know there are still quite a few bugs, but I completed something,
    and for me that's huge. <a href="http://choobert.itch.io/meatlyjam-game-dev-career-sim">Play the game on itch.io</a>.

    <h3><strong>What Went Right?</strong></h3>
    Let's start with the simplicity. Like most people, I think most of my ideas have far too grandiose of schemes...
    and they are never completed. This game jam forced me to choose a very basic game concept, and create it. Along the way,
    I gained considerable knowledge on how to make a bigger game better.

    Recording the music stopped it from getting monotonous. I was inspired to pull out my old trusty guitar that
    I never quite learned, and strum out a few chords. Since the graphics are so low for the game, how high of a quality
    of music do you need? Again by lowering my own expectations I was able to make far more progress than by perfecting
    every last detail.

    Surprisingly, time was not a major concern for me. There was a time that i was getting nervous I would have far too many issues to fix
    before time was up. However, I had envisioned two endings to the game in the beginning. This allowed me to choose the shorter version
    and shift my focus on re-positioning enemies and collectibles, and fixing game breaking bugs. When they say, "The first 90 percent
    of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the
    other 90 percent of the development time." I believe it.

    <h3> <strong>What Went Wrong?</strong></h3>
    Try to read the code and I think you will see right away. With so many hard coded values, and a half baked design from the get go
    it quickly because hard to manage. About half way through I came to the conclusion that I could either improve the structure or
    struggle with it and hope to complete the game faster. In the end I chose to struggle, and it became a larger and larger problem
    as variables became unused or were now doing things that they weren't originally intended.

    <h3><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3>
    Singletons are awesome. I suppose I had already known that, but I have never made a game using a Game Manager as a singleton,
    now I see why my games fall apart. Look for a blog about making a quality Game Manager/framework in the future.

    Secondly, Awake vs Start. Although they function quite similarly I looked up best practices. This is what I was able to learn from Unity docs.

    <p style="padding-left:60px;"><em>Awake</em> - Always the first function called on a script <em>and is run even if the script is not enabled.</em> This
      should primarily be used for references between Scripts and the initialization of variables.</p>

    <p style="padding-left:60px;"><em>Start</em> - Always called before the first Update call. <em>Only executed when the script is enabled<strong>.</strong></em></p>

    <h3><b>Future</b></h3>
    In the next few weeks I intend to take the time to create a Framework of sorts for myself. Throughout the process I created a Game Manager and other classes that should be usable in virtually all games that I make. Yet, those took a considerable amount of time to write (and write poorly). With these written, I will be able to more quickly get a game up and going. I look forward to my next jam and the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">#OneGameAMonth</a> competition, but he next one probably won't be made in &lt; 48 hours.
