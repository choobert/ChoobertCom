    It has been a little while since my last post/update to this site. After a few months of working on a mobile game with Unity,
    I have decided to turn to a Windows based game. Although mobile is a fun platform, the limited controls slowly stopped
    progress before I decided to completely stop working on it.

    Where to next?

    What do I find fun? Breadjamin Butter was a funny but not well thought out concept and in the end just wasn't fun
    to create. I am not completely giving up on him forever, but for now he is falling to the bottom of the pile.

    What do I find fun you say? I have always loved RPG's,
      <a href="http://runescape.com">Runescape]</a>,
      <a href="http://www.kingdomhearts.com">Kingdom Hearts</a>,
      <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com/games/jak_and_daxter">Jak and Daxter</a>,
      <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow">World of Warcraft</a>,
      <a href="http://destinythegame.com">Destiny</a>
    just to name a few. I know all game devs warn against new developers from attempting an RPG as their first real
    game as they are far too expansive, but in an effort to keep the game fun, it is the path I have decided to take.
