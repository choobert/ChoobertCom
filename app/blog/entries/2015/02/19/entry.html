    February is the month of <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/knowitproveit">"Know it. Prove it."</a> with
    Microsoft Virtual Academy. What better time than now to get some more formal training on Unity? After completing the
    first 2 lessons <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developing-2d-3d-games-with-unity-for-windows-jump-start">provided here</a>,
    I have learned several errors in my ways.
    <br><br>
    A couple of items worth noting from the 2D Training...
    <br><br>
    I was unable to find the assets in the Asset Store, and it is very possible I am just blind, however I was able to find them on <a href="https://github.com/TobiahM/10th-Planet">GitHub here.</a>
    <br><br>
    The second item may prevent you from throwing your computer out the window due to losing your work. Have you ever been irritated that you just made several changes to your Scene while the game was playing? Now they're all gone? Well, you can make it slightly more obvious that you are making a huge mistake by changing the background color of all of the surrounding screen as shown in the pictures below. To make the change go to Edit -&gt; Preferences. A pop up as show should appear. Select a color for "Playmode Tint," I personally prefer something a little less obnoxious than this, but it useful for proving the intent.
