		I received a Raspberry Pi over the holidays, and although I have had some ideas for what to do with it, I haven't taken
		the time until now to do them. There are plenty of other guides for how to  set up a Raspberry Pi into anything, I am
		not aiming to provide a guide, but simply what worked and did not work for me.

		<h3>Setting up Raspbian</h3>

		After several re-installs of NOOBs attempting to install all of the desired applications without errors (mysql is my enemy),
		I have a collection of commands/updates to perform to get my Pi up and running. These commands assume that Rasbian has been installed.

		<ol>
			<li>If you are using wireless (like me) you first need to choose a static ip. It is easiest to set it up using the UI to
				avoid mistakes with your internet connectivity. After connecting for the first time, you should see an entry that looks
				familiar in wpa_supplicant.conf
				<pre class='cmd'>
					# /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
					network={
					tssid="Your Wireless SSID"
					psk="Your Password"
					proto=RSN
					key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
					pairwise=TKIP
					auth_alg=OPEN
					}</pre>
			</li>
			<li>At this point you should either know what you would like your static ip address to be or set it to stay at its current
				ip permanently. Before we set up the device for a static IP, first let's get the data we need.
				<br><br>
				First get your netmask (and IP if you like from ifconfig)
				<pre class='cmd'>
					ifconfig</pre>
				Then get your gateway (router IP) from netstat
				<pre class='cmd'>
					netstat -nr</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Now lets set up the device to always use this wireless connection at boot up by editing your interfaces
				<pre class='cmd'>
					sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces</pre>
				Set your file to look similar to the file below
				<pre class='cmd'>
					# /etc/network/interfaces
					auto wlan0
					iface lo inet loopback
					iface eth0 inet dhcp

					allow-hotplug wlan0
					iface wlan0 inet static
					address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx # this is your static ip for the pi
					netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx # netmask for your network
					gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx # IP of your router
					wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
					iface default inet dhcp</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Even though there is a static ip for the device. You will probably want to advertise the device on your
				network so you can access by hostname instead of IP address typing raspberrypi.local is much easier than 192.168.1.123).
				However, to do this we must download avahi-daemon
				<pre class='cmd'>
					sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
					sudo insserv avahi-daemon
					sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Voila! Test it out, attempt to ping your Raspberry Pi from another device! If you are able to ping the IP
				Address and not the hostname. Check your /etc/hosts file. Add an entry for the static ip address and the desired hostname. 
				<strong>Note that the hostname WILL have .local appended.</strong>
			</li>
		</ol>
