		If you're anything like me all of the work you have done through SSH is getting fairly tiring when a tab seems to be a
		monstrous amount of space in nano. Have no fear, every user can have their own unique preferences for nano within their user folder.

		<br><br>
		My personal preferenes are:
		<ol>
			<li>Spaces instead of tabs</li>
			<li>Tab size should be 4 spaces</li>
			<li>No case sensitivity when searching</li>
		</ol>

		<br>
		Keep in mind that I prefer a very limited number of configurations and to view many other configurations visit the
		<a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.1/nanorc.5.html">nano-editors webpage.</a>

		<br><br>
		First step in creating the configurations is to create the configuration file .nanorc. This should be placed in your
		home directory (/home/{userid}/.nanorc).

		<pre class='cmd'>nano ~/.nanorc</pre>

		Then add the following lines to the file and save.

		<pre class='cmd'>
			set tabsize 4
			set tabstospaces
			unset casesensitive</pre>

		Test it out!
