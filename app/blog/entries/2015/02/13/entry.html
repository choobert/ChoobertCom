  <div class='title'>MySQL - "error processing mysql-server-5.5 (--configure)" SOLVED</div>
  <div class='entry'>

    After intending to use sqlite3 as my database for my Raspberry Pi server, the number of limitations seemed overwhelmingly
    annoying to not give MySQL another shot at an installation.  After several problems with the installation resulting in several
    different areas revealing themselves in different way. Again, there are many blogs that provided solutions but none of them
    spelled out the solution for me. My initial errors looked like this:

    <pre class='cmd'>
      [FAIL] Starting MySQL database server: mysqld . . . . . . . . . . . . . . failed!
      invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action "start" failed.
      dpkg: error processing mysql-server-5.5 (--configure):
      subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
      Errors were encountered while processing:
      mysql-server-5.5</pre>

    The most frustrating part of this was that the logs were empty in both /var/log/mysql.log and var/log/mysql.err.
    After searching and searching I noticed that the user mysql did not have permissions on any of the mysql folders. So, I ran the following

    <pre class='cmd'>
      chown mysql /etc/mysql -R
      chown mysql /var/lib/mysql -R
      chown mysql /var/run/mysqld -R</pre>

    After attempting to start the service again, I actually got some info in mysql.log. However, what I believe is the real
    fix came later. If you followed my previous Raspberry Pi guides, you would have set up a static IP Address for yourself.
    For some reason, the Raspberry Pi no longer identifies itself with 127.0.0.1 <strong>BUT</strong> MySQL seems to think it should!
    Edit the configuration and look for the line below and replace it with your static IP Address.

    <pre class='cmd'>
      nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
      bind-address = 127.0.0.1</pre>

    If you are still experiencing problems, look through your daemon.log file and search for mysqld errors.
    Hopefully they are able to point you in the right direction.

    <pre class='cmd'>
      nano /var/log/daemon.log</pre>
