    First and foremost setup port forwarding on your router. It is likely that your ISP is preventing you from
    using port 80 and you will need to select another option, I chose 8080. There are many places online for how to
    set up port forwarding for your router so I will not explain it in detail here. However below is a screenshot
    of the configuration I made to my D-Link router under Advanced-&gt;Port Forwarding for my server.

    Now the fun part, getting everything installed on the Raspberry Pi. To start I like to make sure everything
    is up to date and then move into the installations. I assume that everything installs successfully for you as it did for me.

    <pre class='cmd'>
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 -Y
      sudo apt-get install sqlite3 php5-sqlite3
      sudo chown www-data /var/www</pre>

    This last line is important. Without the correct permissions, your PHP pages will continue to fail whenever they
    attempt to access any sqlite data. Now that everything is downloaded and in place, let's do some light configuration of Apache.

    <pre class='cmd'>
      sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default</pre>

    The very first line should read
    <pre class='cmd'>
      &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</pre>

    The "80" is the current port Apache is listening on. You must alter this number to the port chosen during Port Forwarding.

    <br><br>
    Optionally, if you would like to set up your server for use of .htaccess this is a great opportunity to look for the line:

    <pre class='cmd'>
      AllowOverride None</pre>

    and replace it with:

    <pre class='cmd'>
      AllowOverride ALL</pre>

    With these configuration changes you must have Apache reload its configurations and reboot.

    <pre class='cmd'>
      sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
      sudo service apache2 restart</pre>

    You should now have a functioning web server!!! Attempt to connect to it in your browser now, the path will likely
    be similar to http://raspberrypi.local:8080 . If you just received a page that says, "It works!" then
    pat yourself on the back and get ready for some sqlite3 to add some data.
